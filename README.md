# Usage

## Generate deep.config.json

Automatically catch public ip of server.
```
npx @deep-foundation/deeplinks -g
```

Manual define domains.
```
npx @deep-foundation/deeplinks -g --deeplinks "http://deeplinks.deep.foundation" --deepcase "http://deepcase.deep.foundation"
```

## Deep Terminal

```
npx @deep-foundation/deeplinks -e
>
```

## Launch command envs based on config

For example, let's run migrations. Don't forget to clear the timestamp keys in the .migrate file before migrating.
```
npm @deep-foundation/deeplinks --bash "npx migrate@latest up --matches '*.js'"
```

## Alternative deep.config.json

By default, deep.config.json is taken from the folder in which the command is executed. You can set config alternatively.

```
npm @deep-foundation/deeplinks -c "$(cat ../../call-options.json)"
```
